One of the major issues with active nanophotonic devices is the lack of post-fabrication dynamic
control of light. The techniques employed in the literature limit large-scale integration due to the
small modulation depth or the slow speed. We propose a PT-symmetric phase gradient metasurface
to tune the intensity and angular response of light through dynamic material gain-loss modulation.


#### Phase-gradient PT-symmetric semiconductor metasurface
Our approach supports tunable asymmetric transmission for gain or loss side incidence in a vertically
stacked GaInP metasurface. For loss side normal incidence, the transmission is predominantly in the 0th diffraction order
(η<sub>0</sub> ∼ 0.80; η<sub>1</sub> ∼ 0.18). In contrast, for gain side incidence, an amplified transmission is
observed in the 1st diffraction order (η<sub>0</sub> ∼ 0.04; η<sub>1</sub> ∼ 0.80). With increasing non-Hermiticity factor γ, the asymmetry in transmission increases. The highest
asymmetry with an asymmetry factor of ∼ 0.9 is observed at λ = 655 nm. We explained the physics behind the observed asymmetry and showed an alternate path to realize on-chip reconfigurable nanophotonic devices.
