We are always on the lookout for motivated students interested in pursuing research in our group. If you think you are a good fit please read the following guidelines

##### Internship/Project Associate/JRF positions

Please go through the research and recent publication sections carefully. You may not understand the details of the work but it will give you a sense of the type of the work we do.  IITH faculty receive a large number of emails from prospective students, and it is not possible to respond to generic emails. Please state briefly your previous education, research/project experience and why you are interested in this work. A well-crafted email will improve your chances of getting a response.  

##### IITH Students 

If our research seems to be of interest to you, and you would like to do your project/thesis in our group, please think about the following:

- What are end results you hope to achieve - Job, PhD, Post-doc, research exposure, etc?
- Einstein once said “It’s not that I’m so smart; it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” You would be expected to work hard on your research topics, scientific communication and also contribute to the lab development.
- Please go through some papers in the publications section, and see if you would enjoy working in this area. Also, talk to our group members to figure out if you would like the work we do and the way we do it.
- Once you have done the above please send me an email to schedule an appointment to discuss potential openings.

##### Letters of recommendation

Letters of recommendation are an integral part of an academic career. I will be happy to write letters of recommendation if you meet the following criteria:

1. You have worked on a significant research project with me as a advisor or co-advisor or doctoral committee member (for graduate students)
2. You have taken atleast 2 courses that I offer at IIT Hyderabad, and have been an active participant in class discussions (for BTech students)
3. And more importantly, you have discussed your plans with me well ahead of the deadline - atleast 1 month for BTech students and 1 semester for graduate students
4. If you do not meet the above criteria then the most probable scenario is that I would write a generic letter. This will not help your chances, and you might be better off approaching some one who can give you a strong recommendation
