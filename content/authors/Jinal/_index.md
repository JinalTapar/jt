Jinal Tapar has completed her Ph.D. under the advisement of [Dr. Naresh Emani](https://iith.ac.in/~nke/) at the department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad. Her research interest spans Semiconductor Nanophotonics, Non-Hermitian systems, All-dielectric tunable metasurfaces. 
In her Ph.D. with Dr. Emaniâ€™s group, she investigated the prospects of parity-time symmetric nanophotonic devices for light generation and manipulation bridging nanophotonics and quantum physics. Jinal is an active student member of SPIE, OSA, now renamed Optica, and IEEE Photonics society. 
She has published four journal papers and has presented in premier national and international conferences like META, SPIE, FiO, ICEE etc., resulting in 8 proceedings. 
For more details, please see  her [current CV](files/Jinal_CV_2021.pdf).
